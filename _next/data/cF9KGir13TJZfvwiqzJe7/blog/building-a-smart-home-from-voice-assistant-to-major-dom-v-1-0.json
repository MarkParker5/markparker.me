It worked well at first, but in the free version, the server occasionally crashed and changed its address. I quickly dismissed the VPN tunnel option.

The implementation was straightforward: the application sent a request to the hosting server, where the PHP code added the request body (JSON) to the end of an array and wrote it to a local file. The Raspberry Pi at home sent a read request to this file every second, and after reading it, cleared the array. This way, I was able to send commands home from anywhere on the planet! Similarly, I set up receiving responses from the assistant: I duplicated the implementation and reversed the roles. Two files and four endpoints on the free PHP hosting provided me with stable bidirectional communication with my home assistant. Shortly after, I taught the assistant to send me messages on its own, such as the room number of the next class at the beginning of each break. Before I could boast about it in college, someone started spamming me at home. I had to add authentication: the login and password were hardcoded in the application, and the server had a check kind of this:\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.pre, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.code, {\n        className: \"language-php\",\n        children: \"if ($login == 'markparker' && $password == 'MyVeryStrongP@ssw0rd!') {}; \\n\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"The application's repositories were private, and the server had no repository (why have a repository for just one file with less than 100 lines?), so the level of security was more than sufficient.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Shortly after, the system gained its first automatic command trigger.
